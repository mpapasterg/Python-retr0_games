Pong is one of the first computer games that ever created. This simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball. 
The goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain 10 point. 
A player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball.
The game can be played with two human players using W/S keys(Player A) and Up/Down keys(Player B) for upward/downward movement.
Use Escape key or close the program to exit the game.

You can play the Pong game by simply downloading the "pong.py" file and executing the following command inside a terminal:
> python pong.py
Python 3.0 or higher is required for the program to run.

The present implementation of the classic Pong game is part of the retr0_games Python game list by mpapasterg.
